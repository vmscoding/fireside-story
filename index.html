    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>When the group pulled into the old campground.
      It wasn't quite as bright and welcoming-looking as they remembered.
      The old sign that had once greeted their arrival to summer camp now... </p>
      <p>...Now hung by a single nail, creaking ominously in the breeze. A black cloud drifted in front of the sun. In the depths of their souls, the group felt the spectre of death pass them by.</p>
      <p style="color: red">Albert: Well, heck.</p>
      <p style="color: blue">Joey: This isn't nearly as great as I remember. Do you guys wanna go to Taco Bell instead?</p>
      <p>Their spirits not yet sated by the desolate vista that lay before them, the group set their sights on a plae once compared to the firey depths of Malbolge - the Taco Bell drive-thru.</p>
