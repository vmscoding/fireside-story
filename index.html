    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>When the group pulled into the old campground.
      It wasn't quite as bright and welcoming-looking as they remembered.
      The old sign that had once greeted their arrival to summer camp now... </p>
      <p>...Now hung by a single nail, creaking ominously in the breeze. A black cloud drifted in front of the sun. In the depths of their souls, the group felt the spectre of death pass them by.</p>
